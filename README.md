# 2019-winter-Haskell-school

2019 winter Haskell school in Sydney Australia 



## Class timetables and planning

We are based on [CIS194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html) which is a 12 week course and we will extend it with advanced contents.

Each class has average length of 2 hours. Each week, we will pick a time and place and announce it.



## Materials that we used for this class



Currently we are using [Yorgey's cis194 course](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html). 

This course is widely recommended by Haskell learners. 



## homework and after class discussions



After each week's class, participants need to complete assignments from the cis194 course and submit to this repo as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/fp-works/2019-winter-Haskell-school/pulls).


You can skip the assignments, but remember:
>If you don't do your homework and expect to be a Haskell programmer in the end of this course just by coming to/reading the lecture, you are kidding yourself. &mdash;Shine Li</cite>



You can also raise any questions or issues when you are learning Haskell and raise it to [here](https://github.com/fp-works/2019-winter-Haskell-school/issues). 



You can submit your assignment to this path `cis194/week1/Yourname`, replace Yourname with your own.


if you don't do your homework and expect to be a Haskell programmer in the end of this course just by coming to/reading the lecture, you are kidding yourself.
