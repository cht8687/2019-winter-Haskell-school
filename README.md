# 2019-winter-Haskell-school

2019 winter Haskell school in Sydney Australia 



## Class timetables and planning

This winter session is initially designed to have 10 classes(might extended).

Each class has average length of 2 hours. Each week, we will pick a time and place and will announce it.



## Materials that we used for this class



Currently we are using [Yorgey's cis194 course])(https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell#yorgeys-cis194-course). 

This course is widely recommended by Haskell learners. 



## homework and after class discussions



After each week's class, participants can complete assignments from the cis194 course and submit to this repo as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/fp-works/2019-winter-Haskell-school/pulls).



You can also raise any questions or issues when you are learning Haskell and raise it to [here](https://github.com/fp-works/2019-winter-Haskell-school/issues). 





You can submit your assignment to this path `cis194/week1/Yourname`, replace Yourname with your own.



## Other resources
